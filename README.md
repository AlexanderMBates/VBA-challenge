# Crowdfunding Data Analysis ReadMe

## Background
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have become increasingly popular for launching projects. This challenge involves organizing and analyzing a database of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects to uncover market trends. The dataset, generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, is intended for educational purposes.

## Before You Begin
1. **Create a New Space:** Create a new space called `excel-challenge` in either Dropbox or Google Drive. Do not add this challenge to an existing repository.
2. **Download Files:** Download the [Module 1 Challenge files](#) to get started.

## Files
The challenge involves working with an Excel workbook in the provided .zip file.

## Instructions

### Conditional Formatting
1. Use conditional formatting to color cells in the "Outcome" column based on success, failure, cancellation, or live status.
2. Create a "Percent Funded" column using a formula and apply a three-color scale to highlight funding levels.

### Column Creation
1. Create an "Average Donation" column to find the average amount each project backer paid.
2. Create "Parent Category" and "Sub-Category" columns by splitting the existing "Category" and "Sub-Category" columns.

### Category Stats
1. Create a new sheet with a pivot table analyzing the number of campaigns per category.
2. Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the created table.

### Subcategory Stats
1. Create a new sheet with a pivot table analyzing the number of campaigns per sub-category.
2. Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category based on the created table.

### Date Conversion
1. Create a "Date Created Conversion" and "Date Ended Conversion" columns to convert Unix timestamps to Excel's date format.

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
1. Create a new sheet with a pivot table analyzing outcomes based on launch date.
2. Create a pivot-chart line graph visualizing the created table.

### Report in Microsoft Word
Answer the following questions in a Word document:
1. What are three conclusions about crowdfunding campaigns based on the data?
2. What are the limitations of this dataset?
3. What are other possible tables or graphs, and what additional value would they provide?

### Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
1. Create a new sheet with columns for goal ranges and corresponding headers.
2. Use COUNTIFS() formula to count successful, failed, and canceled projects within each goal range.
3. Calculate percentages and create a line chart depicting the relationship between goal amount and success, failure, or cancellation.

### Statistical Analysis
1. Create a new worksheet with columns for the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
2. Calculate mean, median, min, max, variance, and standard deviation using Excel formulas.
3. Provide a brief justification on whether mean or median better summarizes the data.
