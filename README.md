# VBA Stock Market Analysis ReadMe

## Background
The primary goal of this is to leverage VBA scripting to perform a comprehensive analysis of stock market data. By creating scripts that loop through stock data for a given year, you will extract key information, including the ticker symbol, yearly change in stock prices, percentage change, and the total stock volume. 

## Outline
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.

**NOTE:**
- Used conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
